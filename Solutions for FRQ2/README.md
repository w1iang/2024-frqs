### FRQ 2 - 
## Objective
The objective of FRQ 2 is to write an entire object class which constantly 
updates a scoreboard and whichever team is actively playing at the moment. There 
are two methods which are compiled in the object, "recordPlay" and "getScore."
## Obstacles
I initially struggled with coming up with a way to properly switch between
updating scores between teams. After discussing with my class, I revised my new
solution to contain a boolean variable
## What I learned
Because the root of my issue with my code was not understanding the need for a
boolean variable, it was sort of simple to revise and fix. I learned how to use 
a boolean to simplify the code significantly.
