### FRQ 1 -
## Objective
- The objective of FRQ 1, part a), is to deduce the amount of food left in the 
feeder after a single day. Then in part b), you're meant to calculate the 
potential food left, if any, over the course of a given amount of days. 
## Obstacles
There are some preconditions to the problem, one of them being The 5 percent 
chance of the feeder being scavenged by a bear instead of a bird. To calculate
a percentage at random, I used Math.random(). Then to there is the instance of 
properly calculating the arithmetic value of food left in the feeder. This was
an easy task as it's just java arithmetics. However, for part b), you must call
the method from part a) in order to calculate the total food eaten over the 
period of many days.
