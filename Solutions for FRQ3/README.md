### FRQ 3 -
## Objective
- For part a) of FRQ 3, the objective is to create a method which makes an
arrayList of words, each containing the last phrase. The code will conclude itself
when the next word doesn't have the last phrase. In the instance of part b), the 
objective of the assignment is to create a new method out of a wordList (part a),
making a list of words from wordList that 
## Obstacles
- The assignment is pretty straightforward, but you might struggle to ensure
every word is checked for the last one and avoiding out of bounds errors. It's 
also important to make sure you use the right methods for array list and not the
methods for normal arrays.
## What I Learned
- I made the mistake of using length() instead of size() during my original
response which I corrected on the GitHub Repo. Other than that, I rewrote the
a similar solution I had on the AP exam.
